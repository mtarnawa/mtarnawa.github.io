Is it worth the hassle? No.

But if you're considering doing it, then you're mind is probably already set on diving into the tinkering rabbithole.

## What do i need to buy?

This is based on 5th gen (or 5.5 gen) iPod Classic which is the easiest one to dissassemble and mod and has ton of replacement parts available. It also has, arguably, the "better DAC" (made by Wolfson) compared to later models. It also assumes no soldering (see optional)

### Must:


* **An iPod**. Unless you already have one. Now bear in mind, Apple was very good at this capitalism game from the beginning. That's why you have 30 iterations of iPods to choose from. 
* **Cable** - remember, Apple loved making their own standard. In my case that was 30pin -> USB-A.
* **SD card module** if you went with the low-capacity, older model with spinning disk.
* **Battery** - it's been 20 years, original battery is probably botched and its capacity is either way undewrwhelming compared to what modern lithium-ion batteries offer.

### Optional:

* **Front panel**
* **Back panel**
* **Headphone output** - if the original is behaving funky (shouldn't though).

### Not recommended:

* **Bluetooth module** - it's not great, requires ton of effort and still has issues with connectivity etc. You're buying stuff from 2000s, just use proper set of IEMs with it.
* **Taptic engine** - don't be ridiculous.
* **USB-C port** - unless you like soldering.

There's a [good guide by **yuuiko** on which iPod to pick ](http://www.yuuiko.space/iPodGuide/iPodGuidev2-1.pdf)

## The good 

Well, it's a 20 year old hardware that you can make play FLAC, have modern capacity, amazing battery lifeparametric EQ for your overpriced headphones and a cool look, vibes and ergonomics. 


## The bad

You're selecting between Rockbox and the native interface and both are very opitionated in terms of design choices if you're coming in in 2026. This isn't the only PMP (Portable Media Player) that I own so I dabbled with HibyOS, whatever Xduuo portable stuff is called and obviously Android and if you want a hassle free experience... just go with something on Android instead of investing time and resources in the iPod, whatever firmware it'll run. 

Hardware-wise, Wolson DAC sounds nice and warm as widely reported, but even with mods, you just can't make iPod to a point it's modern hardware that supports things as trivial as Bluetooth (I mean you can, at significant cost), USB-C (again, you can with enough confidence, soldering skills and self-preservation) or fancy things like balanced output. 

Don't get me wrong, I love Rockbox, but it's not for everyone, it requires time and effort to set-up initially, to find a non-atrocious theme and fight with some of the limitations and defaults. I had to spent quite a bit, researching and trying to modify the theme with CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) font support so that all the Citypop tracks could be displayed properly (not that I can read moonrunes, but I'm pedantic enough to care).

## The ugly 

The setup looks good for... a week. The knock-off front plates and the transparent plastic on the screen scratches easily. Actually, easily is an understatement - I feel I'm scratching it by merely looking at it. My 5th gen was bought in a rough shape and I'm getting close to matching it after keeping it in the pocket and treating it with care. I'll definitely go with transparent front plate next time, even though the yellow one looks so much sexier.

Other than that, I was surprised with the fit. Of course it's nowhere near what would be marked as "Designed by Apple Inc in California" but it's still unexpectedly well manufactured. It's the materials that fall short.
